I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Data Science at the College of William & Mary, advised by Prof. Haipeng Chen.

My research lies at the intersection of reinforcement learning and generative modeling, including both transformer-based large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models.
I am particularly interested in physics-inspired and health-related applications that bridge machine learning with real-world impact.

Outside of research, I am a 100% cat lover. üêæ
